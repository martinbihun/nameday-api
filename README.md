```
##### Request nameday in country calendar

>searchByName(string $day, string $countryCode)

Both parametrs are required. Parameter ```$countryCode``` must be one of the supported [country codes](https://api.abalin.net/documentation)

echo $nameday->searchByName('Jan','cz'); # {"calendar":"cz","results":[{"day":24,"month":5,"name":"Jana"},{"day":24,"month":6,"name":"Jan"} ... }}
```

### Specification of Timezene

Timezone is set by local ```php.ini``` settings. Terefore ```$nameday->today()``` will return result according to that.
If you need to specify different timezone you can do so by adding optional parameter ```$timeZone``` to the constructor.
```$timeZone``` must be  [PHP timezones](https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php) string or integer [offset to GMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UTC_time_offsets).

```php
$nameday = new Nameday('Pacific/Honolulu');
echo $nameday->today(); # will return today namedays according to Pacific/Honolulu timezone
```

```php
$nameday = new Nameday('+13:30');
echo $nameday->tomorrow(); # will return today namedays according to given UTC offset
```

### Certificate
Make sure you have proper certificates stored on your local machine as Nameday API uses HTTPS only. 

If you run into problems with server certificate try downloading the [The Mozilla CA certificate store](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html), save it on your system and configure ```php.ini```
```ini
[curl]
; A default value for the CURLOPT_CAINFO option. This is required to be an
; absolute path.
curl.cainfo ="C:\...\cacert.pem"
```
